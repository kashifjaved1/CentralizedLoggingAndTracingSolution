# CentralizedLoggingAndTracingSolution
### A basic exemplary solution where I demonstrated how to centralize the logging, tracing and metrics by saving them to db via action filter, middleware and open-telementry.
### - To kickstart, just do following
#### 1. Clone it.
#### 2. Set UI or Api as startUp project and run command "update-database". It'll create localDb relevant to project.
#### 3. Configure startUp project to multi and put both UI and Api to start option.
#### 4. Boom!!! you're good to go.
